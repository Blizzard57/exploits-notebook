\begin{abstract}
A thorough foray into exploitation and explanation of why it 
works the way it does. It is a compilation of sorts, and hence no 
correlation between chapters ( No flow b/w chapters exist ) and the 
book should exist as a case study and used to solve problems which 
look similar and also has some basics which I go learning on the 
way forward.
