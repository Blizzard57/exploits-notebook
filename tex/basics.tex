\section{Data}
There are many places to store data on a typical computer like  a hard drive (or any other secondary storage device), RAM (SRAM and DRAM), CPU Caches and Registers. A hierarchy is decided on their access speed.  If a piece of data is required more frequently, it is stored on a faster storage device. ( Faster implies lower latency i.e. time taken from being asked for data and providing it). The figure 1 shows this heirarchy.

\subsection*{Location}

\subsubsection*{Register}
A register is located in the CPU itself and as it is physically the closest, it also the fastest. It is the one that is accessed while running a program.\\
A sample data flow can be seen in Figure 2, which shows data tranfer from RAM to Register and then to the CPU.

    \caption{Circuit of CPU}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Cache}
A cache is small piece of memory located near the CPU and works as a faster RAM (sort of). It caches the data which the OS thinks is required the most.\\
L1 \& L2 cache is built into the proccessor (recent ones anyway) and is individual for every physical core whereas L3 cache is located outside of the actual silicon but is in the chip and so is common for  all cores.

\subsubsection*{RAM}
RAM is a volatile memory where all the memory that is deemed by the OS as required is stored for instant access with the CPU. The data tranfer happens from RAM $\rightarrow$ Cache $\rightarrow$ Register.

\subsection*{Bridges}
Bridges are small microcontrollers with built in logic which help in  communication with external devices. There are two of there, and are descibed by their position on the board and also the threshold speed  they can manage.

\subsubsection*{North Bridge}
North bridge is a controller chip which connect high speed external devices to the chipset. It was originaly outside ot the main chip and an external silicon but now is mostly included in the SoC ( System on a chip ). The devices which can be connected to it are given in Figure 3.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{South Bridge}
South bridge is the chipset which connects slower and legacy devices to the main chip. It is still seperate on Intel boards but is now starting to get integrated in AMD motherboards.

\subsection*{Data Flow}
So the data flow happens as follows :
\begin{center}$Solid\ State \rightarrow South\ Bridge \rightarrow RAM 
\rightarrow Register $
\end{center}
So when a computer is started, it first POSTS and then goes to the BIOS after which the BIOS piont the program to the Magic Number (For legacy MBR systems) which has the bootloader in it (Like GRUB), after which the bootloader takes control of the System, then loades the kernel and with that the OS, which loads itself in the RAM, for fast access (The most recently executed programs still in the registers and cache) after which the OS loads a GUI ( If it has one ) or just greets to a TTY terminal. For the non GUI version, it gets you to a log in screen, whicle for GUI an application is loaded which takes care of logging in ( Known as a Display Manager (DM) ).
