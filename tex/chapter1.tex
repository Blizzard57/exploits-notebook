\chapter{Binary Exploits}

\section*{Introduction}
Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application
t it violates some trust boundary in a way that is advantageous to you, 
the attacker.The exploits are explained breifly and then given case 
studies for it to be understood better.

\section{Buffer Overflow}
A buffer overflow occurs when a piece of data overflows the storage space
given to it. In these types of exploits, usually stack smashing occurs which 
changes value of non intended variables and helps in changing the flow of the 
program in some way.

\subsection{Stack}
One of the most important component to understand for binary exploitation and 
by extention buffer overflow is the stack. It is the location where all the 
variables and
